\chapter{Enviroments}
 
Since computer vision tasks are its own research domain, not yet fully explored, we conclude that tackling 
difficulties that would reliance on coputer vision model bring is not within the scope of this thesis. 
Consequently we focus mainly on enviroments with more semantically rich output.
\section{Gymnasium}

\subsection{Cartpole}
Cartpole is one of the most known benchmark enviroments in the Gymnasium library. It's a simple enviroment where the agent controls a cart rolling on flat surface with a pole on top.
The goal is to keep the pole balanced on top of the cart. The reward is calculated every step dpending on the angle 
\subsection{Lunar Lander}
Lunar Lander is somewhat more complex domain to optimise for than the Cartpole.  
Every step the reward is calculated based on several criteria, as oposed to only an angle of a stick, controling the landers descend and additional points are awarded for completing certain tasks.
Additionally there are several variables determining the enviroments behaviour during evaluations such as the strenght of wind Unlike in cartpole where
