\chapter{Introduction to Artificial Agents}
To understand the reasoning guiding this work we have to first look at the fundamental subject of our efforts - the artificial agents.
\begin{defn}\citep{russell2021}
A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve
best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.
\end{defn}
\section{Reactive agents}



\section{Reinforcement learning}
\begin{defn}
A reward is a numerical evaluation of agent's behavior within a given enviroment. A reward function then is a function which assigns pair of state and action a real numerical value.
\end{defn}

\section{Numerical Algorithms}
In this section we will be reviewing different aproaches to implementation of evolutionary algoAlgorithmsrithms which were considered
for the purpose of this thesis.
Because we are optimising
The algorithms were selected based on usefulness for the purposes of numerical optimalisation but also for their representativness of certain aspects of the field.
Since the aim of this work is to compare aproaches of formulating utility function optimised by the evolution rather than the algorithms as such, 
we will consider them in their simplest form still expedient for satisfactory optimalisation of selected tasks.
